	<h2>About Intwine</h2>
	<p>Artists can sell merch, tickets and physical copies on the site along side their social media posts. We have a vision to make an all in one package for artists to brand themselves as well as a one stop platform for fans to get to know their artists in one unified space.
	<br><br>
	We are really excited for our users to discover new artists that they might love as well as finding out new things about artists that they already love. 
	<br><br>
	This website is a work in progress, please be patient. </p>
